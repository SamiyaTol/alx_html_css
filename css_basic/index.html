     <h2>Perfectionism </h2>
     <h3>How can perfectionism effect productivity</h3>
    
     <p>Perfectionism is one of the things that kept me paralyzed for over a decade.
         And I don't want anyone to waste years of their life, struggling with it like I did. So let's get started.
          First, we're going to do some mindset work and then we'll get into the concrete ways to overcome perfectionism.</p>

     <p>Perfectionism is the idea that something is only worth doing if it's done perfectly.
         So if you're unable to be perfect, you experience extreme anxiety and things take you forever to finish.
         
         If your perfectionism doesn't paralyze you completely and make you perpetually procrastinate that is.</p>
     <p>If you struggle with extreme perfectionism, it's likely because somebody in your childhood taught you through 
        their words and actions that you'd better be perfect or else. You learned that you had to be 
        perfect in order to protect yourself from emotional and/or physical harm.</p>
